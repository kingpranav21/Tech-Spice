	The safest insanely fast FPV racer on the planet
Weight: 795g | Dimensions : 178 x 232 x 127mm (without props) | Sensor: 1/2.3in CMOS | Camera resolution: 12MP | EFL: 14.6mm | Field of View: 150˚ | Shutter: Electronic, 1/50-1/8000 sec | Video Resolution: 4K@60fps | Color: 8-bit | Gimbal: 1-axis | Battery life:: 20 minutes | Max Range: 10km / 6mi | Max flight: 20 mins | Storage: MicroSD | Collision sensors: Forward / Downward | Max Speed: 140kph / 87mph <br>

Fun beyond any rational measure
Exceptional collision prevention for FPV
Not targeted on photographers
This is the kind of tech so gorgeous and exciting a Luddite would rethink their life goals on first sight. Apparently eschewing their usual creative goals, DJI have put everything into making this a speedy stunt-capable drone which can more than hold its own in the world of FPV racing; it has a top speed of 140kph and the first 100 of that can be reached in a blinding 2 seconds.
<br>

Not forgetting their photography customers (and perhaps understanding that an ordinary racer costs somewhat less), this drone has also been equipped with a much more capable camera system than usually seen on similar drones. The standard practice is to strap a GoPro to the top and recover the footage later, but here a single axis gimbal (still one more than most FPV racers) has been paired with software to achieve a system capable of capturing excellent 4K video at 60fps, meaning this drone might be for more than just racers.

		The ultimate travelling photographer’s drone
Weight: 907g | Dimensions (folded): 214 x 91mm x 84mm | Dimensions (unfolded): 322 x 242 x 84 | Sensor: 1” CMOS | Camera resolution: 20MP | EFL: 28mm | Field of View: 77˚ | Shutter: Electronic, 8-1/8000 sec | Video Resolution: 4K@30fps | Color: 10-bit | Gimbal: 3-axis | Battery life: 31 minutes (3850mAh) | Collision sensors: Omnidirectional | Max Range: 8km / 5mi | Max Speed: 72kph / 44.7mph

1-inch sensor for low-noise images
10-bit video for post-processing
No mechanical shutter
The Mavic 2 Pro takes advantage of DJI’s acquisition of iconic camera manufacturer Hasselblad back in 2017 – incorporating Hasselblad's processing algorithms into the best camera found on any compact drone. 
Cinematographers will appreciate the support for 10-bit Dlog-M and HDR video (allowing post-processing), while photographers will be equally excited by the high ISO shooting and rich quality provided by the large image sensor. 
While many pros might not mind carrying bigger equipment, the ability to be able to sneak this into a spare lens bay in a camera bag provides multi-tasking pro photographers with a whole new dimension. DJI’s Occusync technology means the Mavic 2s can be paired with the company’s stunning FPV goggles, making this truly one of the best DJI drones around. </p>

All the drone you can possibly get under the registration weight
Weight: 242g | Dimensions (folded): 138mm x 81mm x 58mm | Dimensions (unfolded): 159 x 203 x 56mm | Sensor: 1/2.3in CMOS | Camera resolution: 12MP | Maximum aperture: ƒ/2.8 | EFL: 24mm | Field of View: 83˚ | Shutter: Electronic, 4-1/8000 sec | Video Resolution: 4K@30fps | Color: 8-bit | Gimbal: 3-axis | Max Range: 10km / 6.2mi | Max flight: 30 mins | Storage: MicroSD | Collision sensors: Downward | Max Speed: 57kph / 35.7mph
<br>

A lot of drone for the money<br>
4K video and Raw mode camera<br>
No forward collision sensors<br>


The Mini 2 is a reimaging of the Mavic Mini (see below); it takes a well-engineered ultra-light airframe (the weight is non-negotiable) and addresses the areas which drone geeks complained about. Well, the ones who usually flew much more expensive drones mentioned, anyway. Principally these were: the radio range, the response to cross wind, and an assortment of camera features. <br>
Now the Mini 2 has essentially the same fantastic new OcuSync 2.0 controller from the Mavic Air II, with automatic frequency hopping. Together with  more powerful motors and improved software this drone can handle Force 5 (not too bad for such a light craft). Photographers have been rewarded with Raw, Exposure Bracketing (though only 3 stops), and DJI’s spectacular automated panorama features, while video enthusiasts finally have 4K under 250g (and a shiny logo near the lens to prove it), topped off with digital zoom (useful to have, not essential to use). <br>


The new drone also sports some improvements to file transferring making it easier to go from drone to phone, and an extra hue-changing light for, er… well, it’s fun to change the color using the remote. Perhaps the next update will bring a better reason <br>
