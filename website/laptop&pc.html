Apple introduced an all-new iMac featuring a much more compact and remarkably thin design, enabled by the M1 chip. The new iMac offers powerful performance in a design that’s just 11.5 millimeters thin, with a striking side profile that practically disappears.
Available in an array of vibrant colours to match a user’s personal style and brighten any space, iMac features a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display with 11.3 million pixels, 500 nits of brightness, and over a billion colours, delivering a brilliant and vivid viewing experience.
The new iMac also includes a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, studio-quality mics, and a six-speaker sound system — the best camera and audio ever in a Mac. Also, Touch ID comes to iMac for the first time, making it easier than ever to securely log in, make purchases with Apple Pay, or switch user profiles with the touch of a finger.
Combining the power and performance of M1 and macOS Big Sur, apps launch with blazing speed,
 everyday tasks feel incredibly fast and fluid, and demanding workloads like editing 4K video and 
 working with huge images are faster than ever. The new iMac joins the incredible family of Mac 
 models powered by M1, including MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, marking another 
 step forward in Apple’s transition to Apple silicon.<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/imac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display/" ><button class="more_details" type="submit">Explore more...</button></a>

Samsung has been trying to elbow its way into the productivity tablet conversation for years, but it’s never quite reached the level of Apple or Microsoft in terms of functionality, quality, or popularity. A lot of that comes down to the software: last year’s Galaxy Tab S6 was beset with bugs, confusing software, and unfinished features that just ruined the experience, despite the S6’s impressive hardware.
This year, Samsung is giving it another go. It’s sticking with its Android-based approach, but it’s now offering two different sizes — the 11-inch Tab S7 and the 12.4-inch Tab S7 Plus — to more squarely compete with Apple’s two iPad Pro models. The Tab S7 starts at $649.99, while the Tab S7 Plus commands $849.99. Both come with Samsung’s S Pen stylus in the box, and either size can be paired with an optional keyboard case for $199.99 or $229.99, respectively.

The absolute best thing by far about either Tab S7 the display. The S7 Plus has a 12.4-inch OLED 
panel that is bright, vibrant, and pixel-dense. Colors practically jump off the screen, and the 
blacks are as inky and deep as they are on the LG OLED TV hanging in my living room. Topping it 
off is the 120Hz refresh rate, which makes every interaction buttery smooth. The 11-inch Tab S7 
swaps out the OLED for LCD but maintains the 120Hz refresh rate. It’s also an excellent screen that
is bright enough to use outdoors and has almost as punchy colors and contrast as the S7 Plus. It 
really only looks worse when you do a side-by-side comparison, so just don’t do that if you’re 
leaning toward the 11-inch model.
