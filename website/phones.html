 				A14 Bionic, the fastest chip in a smartphone.
                An edge-to-edge OLED display. Ceramic Shield with four times better drop performance. And Night mode on every camera. iPhone 12 has it all — in two perfect sizes.
                <br>


 				Apple has loaded in the usual upgrades like a faster processor and improved camera, but that’s something we’ve come to expect. In addition to all of that, there’s a new design, a new OLED screen, an entirely new charging and accessory ecosystem with MagSafe, and, of course, 5G.<br>

               It seems obvious that both Apple and its carrier partners are trying to align to make this a supercycle for upgrades. All of that new stuff is also paired with both a higher price ($829 for the base 64GB model) and discounts and heavily marketed carrier trade-in and installment plans. In the midst of a pandemic-induced economic downturn, it could be a hard sell.<br>

               It’s easy to recommend the default iPhone for the times when you need a new phone anyway, but it’s much more difficult to say whether all of this new stuff adds up to something that could compel you to upgrade earlier than you’d planned<br>

 			<p class="max2">The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone. The biggest iPhone ever made, in fact.
<br>
The Pro Max’s 6.7-inch display is the largest screen ever on an iPhone. It has the biggest camera sensor of any iPhone, including the three other iPhone 12 models Apple announced this year. It has a 5G radio, and it’s got a bigger battery. It is without question the most iPhone you can get.
<br>
And while it’s expensive, it’s not that much more expensive than the smaller iPhone 12 Pro: it’s just $100 more at every storage level, starting at $1,099 with 128GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for 512GB of storage. For that money, you get a larger display, a bigger battery, and a very different camera system. I’ll just cut to the chase and say it’s absolutely worth it over the standard 12 Pro if you can deal with the size — but it’s a lot of size. And the camera is worth exploring in depth, because there’s a lot going on.
<br>

Like I said, it’s the most iPhone you can get.

 <p class="max2" >It’s a weird sort of relief to be reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.

Depending on how you count, it’s either the second, third, or even fourth iteration of Samsung’s folding phone design. The first was pulled from the market days before release because it was too fragile. The second was the official release, but it was still surrounded by a fog of uncertainty. The third was a different kind of phone, the Z Flip, where Samsung first tested some new screen and hinge technologies. And finally, we’re here, with the Z Fold 2.

Through that persistent iteration, Samsung has achieved two things. First, though I can’t really say it will be as durable as a normal phone, I do have a fair amount of faith that this Fold 2 won’t damage itself through normal use. Second, it’s established the category itself, meaning I can spend a little less time meditating on the meaning and import of folding phones as a concept.

Instead, I can just talk about it as a device and tell you whether I think it’s any good instead of spending all of my time on questions of durability or whether the thing even deserves to exist in the first place. And then, I can just provide a recommendation on whether to consider buying it.
