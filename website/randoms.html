					AirTag is a super-easy way to keep track of your stuff. Attach one to your keys, slip another in your backpack. And just like that, they’re on your radar in the Find My app, where you can also track down your Apple devices and keep up with friends and family. <br>

                    It was starting to get really worried that I wouldn’t find my friend.

                 For this first look at AirTags, I sent Vjeran Pavic off into an unfamiliar city with a single Apple AirTag and no phone, no smartwatch, or any other mode of communication. The challenge was to see if Apple’s Find My system for locating AirTags would be able to lead me to him.
				Apple AirTags weren’t designed for an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. They can help you locate anything they’re attached to; most of the time you’ll be listening for their little chirps as you hunt down the keys you inexplicably left sitting on top of the fridge instead of on the hook where they belong. For that purpose they work incredibly well, right on down to a little arrow on the iPhone’s screen pointing in the direction and little haptic taps as encouragement that you’re getting warmer.

But this exercise was a very good stress test for the new $29 iPhone accessory ($99 for a four pack), because it meant that the only chance I had of tracking Vjeran down is if one of the near-billion Find My-enabled devices on the planet happened to pick up the AirTag’s Bluetooth signal and send it back to me.</p>

What a missed opportunity. With that out of the way, let’s talk about the new Galaxy Buds Live. The company’s latest true wireless earbuds and their unconventional design have leaked extensively over the last few months, and I’ve had many questions along the way. How do you achieve noise cancellation with earbuds that don’t seal in your ears? Can this bean shape possibly feel comfortable?
The $169.99 Buds Live have a style all their own. They’re super reflective in the bronze color, which can look more rose gold in some lighting. But I generally like the look and the fact that Samsung is experimenting. You’ve never worn earbuds quite like these, which means putting them in the first few times feels a bit foreign, and you might overthink it. Turns out, they slot into the concha of my ears quite naturally — the bean design works! — and are both comfortable and stable once there. There are no silicone tips; the speaker points directly into your ear canal. The Buds Live have some silicone stabilizers near the top, and there’s a slightly larger set included in the box if those help the buds better sit in your ears’ contours. </p>

Samsung's SmartTag is a small, battery-powered device that you can attach to things like a wallet, backpack or even your pet. Each SmartTag is powered by the very common and affordable CR2032 battery and is user-replaceable. 
Once it's set up and linked to your Samsung account, the tag can be found using the SmartThings Find app on your phone 
Tiny gadgets that help you track down lost items are all the rage this year. In addition to Samsung announcing SmartTag and SmartTag Plus trackers in January. Apple recently announced and released its own Tile-like device, the AirTag. Both devices are similar in that they rely on Bluetooth to help you keep tabs on your keys, a backpack, luggage or even a pet. But there's more to it than that. 
There are several things to know about Samsung's SmartTag. For a start, SmartTags connect to SmartThings Find, a service that's already built directly into Samsung Galaxy phones -- SmartThings is Samsung's app and hub for compatible smart home devices. Additionally, not all SmartTags are created equal. There are actually two different models. The standard SmartTag launched earlier this year, while the SmartTag Plus was only recently made available to purchase.
