					Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It’s also powerful enough to support 60fps Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.
<br>
The old Apple TV 4K, which has been Apple’s flagship set-top box for four years, supports 4K streaming as well as HDR, including Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound codecs. But it doesn’t support 120Hz refresh rates, which might be important should you ever want to play serious games on an Apple TV. It also has the most notoriously bad remote control.
<br>
Fortunately, Apple has completely redesigned the remote for the new Apple TV 4K with an improved, more ergonomic design and more capabilities. The new remote is thicker than the prior model, has a new five-way touch controller in place of the maligned swipe pad of the original, and a proper power button to turn off your TV. The Siri search button has been moved to the side of the remote, under your right thumb.

					After weeks of drip-feeding information, the OnePlus TV has finally been announced for real. It’s a 55-inch TV with a QLED panel, as we knew, and OnePlus says it has a “sleek minimalist design” with a “nearly bezel-less screen.” So it’s a TV, then.<br>

The OnePlus TV offers quantum dot color and supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, though OnePlus hasn’t yet given detailed information on more technical aspects like the local dimming solution. But the company claims the TV’s color range is best-in-class among QLED competitors. There’s also a 50-watt, eight-speaker setup that OnePlus says provides a “surreal surround sound experience” through Dolby Atmos support. The speaker bar lowers down from the bottom of the TV and rises back into the body when not in use.
