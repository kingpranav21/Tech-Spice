					The Apple Watch Series 6 is the best smartwatch you can buy. Now in its sixth iteration, the wearable category king has spoiled users with buttery smooth performance, velvety haptics and trouble-free setup. Everything about the Apple Watch experience is almost obnoxiously seamless, and that’s a big reason why it owns nearly half the market.<br>

So what's new? The Apple Watch 6 offers blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring for the first time, a brighter always-on display, an always-on altimeter and a faster chip. Rival smartwatch manufacturers seem to be taking larger leaps forward with their products, while Apple sticks to its incremental process (and it’s 18-hour battery life).<br>
The watchOS 7 software update brings some useful tools, too, including Apple Watch sleep tracking. There's also a slew of new watch faces and watch bands. So long as you’re jumping to the Apple Watch 6 from the Series 4 or older, the combination of refreshed hardware, software and accessories supplies a more significant upgrade. <br>

				<p class="max2">Apple’s smartwatch lineup has gone from straightforward to surprisingly complex seemingly overnight. Where we used to have this year’s model or last year’s model at a lower price to choose from, now Apple is selling three distinct Apple Watch models at varying price tiers and with varying options. <br>

In this piece I’m reviewing the one in the middle: the brand-new, but not really new inside, Apple Watch SE. Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, it’s considerably less than the flagship Series 6 and not that much more expensive than the aging Series 3. <br>

The SE is technically a new model for Apple, but much like the iPhone SE, it’s not exactly new inside and out. Essentially, it’s the same thing as a Series 4 from 2018, with just two minor differences: the SE doesn’t have the ability to measure your ECG, but does have an always-on altimeter. The latter is unlikely to have an impact on your use, while the former might be important to some people. Otherwise, it has the same design, performance, and capabilities as the Series 4.

				<p class="max2">
					Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 for about a week now, and it has accomplished something remarkable: it’s made me decide to stop saying there are no good smartwatch options for Android users. <br>
Released just six months after its predecessor, the Active 2 is a reasonably good option. Some software issues keep it from being great, though. And if your phone isn’t made by Samsung, plan on some software annoyances. <br>
The obvious and clear success of the Apple Watch for iPhone owners has made the dearth of quality options for Android phones feel that much more acute. But Samsung has been quietly plugging away at improving the Galaxy Watch and the software that runs it. The result is a watch that checks off most of the boxes smartwatch buyers should care about <br>
The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a round smartwatch that starts at $279, though you can pay higher prices depending on the size and LTE. It comes in 40 and 44mm sizes, has a few different finishes, and the watch bands can be easily swapped out. (The original Active is still available and slightly less expensive. The original Galaxy Watch with a physical rotating bezel is also sticking around for a higher price.) <br>
I like how unassuming the Active 2 looks. I have the basic black model, and its matte finish and slightly curved glass give it simple, clean lines. In a world where most Android smartwatches either look explicitly like fitness bands (the Fitbit) or emulate big, expensive watches (hiding how big they need to be), the Active 2 just looks like a simple watch.<br>
It is not a watch I expected to exist because its predecessor is barely six months old. The main problem with the last one is that Samsung whiffed on supporting the very best feature of the Galaxy Watch lineup: a rotating bezel for scrolling through the software.<br>
The Active 2 doesn’t fully bring that back, but it now has a touch-sensitive capacitive ring around the screen. Dragging your finger around it to scroll through various screens feels much more intuitive than just swiping because the Active 2’s interface is mostly built on circles.</p>
